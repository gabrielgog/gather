  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="box">
      <div class="box-image full"><img src="images/challenge1.png"></img></div>
      <h5 class="block__title">Interoperability</h5>
      <p>Existing tools collect data with specific forms instead of mapping them to defined structures. This complicates the flow of data between data-producing and data-consuming applications and entails expensive processes of data export and restructuring before publication can take place. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <div class="box-image full"><img src="images/challenge2.png"></img></div>
      <h5 class="block__title">Timely Collection and Publication</h5>
      <p>Public health workers are frequently dispatched to remote locations to collect or update medical data. They need a tool able to store data modifications, synchronize them once they regain connection, and stream real time data to external applications. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <div class="box-image full"><img src="images/challenge3.png"></img></div>
      <h5 class="block__title">Data Curation</h5>
      <p>Raw collected data often need to be modified before publishing. However, most of the existing data collection tools do not support data curation. This includes data validation, deduplication, ID assignment, and enrichment from external sources. </p>

  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="block">
      <h5 class="block__title">Data Collection Management</h5>
      <p>Gather works with the ODK Collect Mobile App which performs surveys in the field and a Web App that manages campaigns, creates, and administers the data collectors and monitors the progress of data collection. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <h5 class="block__title">Data Curation Processes </h5>
      <p>Being built on the Aether platform, Gather can perform data curation activities such as masking data for privacy requirements or integrating them with other systems and workflows for management, transformation, and analysis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">

      <h5 class="block__title">Timely and Secure Data Publication</h5>
      <p>Gather can be deployed using high trust cloud environments such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, as well as on-premises deployment in order to reinforce security and better manage data sharing workflows.</p>

      <h5 class="block__title">The Impact of Gather</h5>
      <p>Developed in 2015 for a nutrition project in Somalia, Gather is currently in use on a number of different projects in several countries, and has already collected data from hundreds of thousands of submissions. Here are a few recent projects where Gather was used:</p>

      <div class="box-content">
        <h5 class="block__title">CHAMPS - Sierra Leone</h5>
        <p>The CHAMPS (Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance) Network is a global program aiming to identify and prevent child death through disease surveillance, death registries, and data collection. CHAMPS uses Gather to collect the data in Sierra Leone and share them across-countries within the organization’s network. Gather guarantees data security and government’s control over the collected Information.</p>

        <h5 class="block__title">GRID - Nigeria</h5>
        <p>The GRID (Geospatial Reference Information Data) project collects spatial reference data and other points of interest such as health facilities, schools, markets, post offices, etc. to create a geodatabase that the government uses for data-driven decision making. Gather collects the data and makes sure that new data collection efforts fit right into the existing data pipelines and publishing processes.</p>

        <p>The DRC Microcensus project aims to conduct a microcensus in the region of Kinshasa and Bandundu to predict how many people live in each settlement and estimate the total population for DRC. The project needed a very tailored solution for data collection with an advanced UI able to reproduce maps. Gather software versatility allowed to create a very specific solution in a short period of time.</p>
